In this program I kept the approach quite simple. I have used Dictionary to store the information of a person and used independent variables for food quantity requirement storage. Another dictionary is used to store the data regarding quantity and price corresponding to the food. Dictionary approach can later help us to store our data easily in a database. My program is only Command Line Based. Other than that, I have dove sufficient in-code commenting for better readability of the code.
