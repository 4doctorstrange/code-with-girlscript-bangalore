# EASY PACMAN

## Simulation

## Approach

1. A static maze is created using a readabale, easily editable string in `utilities.maze`. This string is automatically converted to a 2D array when playing the game.
2. `Maze` class handles the characteristics of the maze, converts inputs into valid movements and validates new positions.
3. `PacMan` class handles the movement of `PacMan` in the `Maze`.
4. `game.py` has the code which creates the `PacMan` and `Maze` objects and handles inputs from user. It prints the current maze after each input.
