## Pacman Game - Easy Solution

### by Prachi Sabarad

For this easy level of Pacman, I've used the *pynput* module of **Python** to listen to keyboard key presses. 
The maze is a 2-D array.
Everytime it detects the Arrow keys or the WASD keys, the position of the Pacman, i.e. character '@' is altered in the maze and displayed on the screen.
